# Neural-Machine-Translation-and-fine-tuning-
Fine tuning Neural Machine Translation using BART(Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers ) 

Details of project is explained in presentation.ipynb file go and visit it to understand the project completely. Also History of LLMs and NLP is presented in simple and easy to understand way go visit it. Data was trained on BERT( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and later fine tuned on BART 

In NMT.ipynb contains code of how to fine tune dataset. I was unable to run full code due to less memory resources but one who has memory resources can check this code out by running it full.

Presentation file also contain explanation of how to fine tune LLM using LoRA
